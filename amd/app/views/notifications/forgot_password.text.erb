Someone just reset your HOPE AMD password (hopefully you).

Your new HOPE AMD username is <%= @login %>. Your new password is <%= @pass %>.

P.S. If this isn't your account and you've managed to get into someone else's account, contact someone on the HOPE AMD team and we'll give you kudos for the hack. Please don't be the douchebag who creates a ton of unnecessary work for the volunteers. KTHX!
