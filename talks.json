This qualitative study examines this issue through an economic analysis of a sample of threads from ten active publicly accessible web forums that traffic in malware and personal information. Specifically, this talk will consider the costs of trojans, botnets, iframes tools, spam, DDoS services, and credit card information for victims and offenders to estimate dollar losses for victims relative to the economic gains for offenders who utilize and provide these resources.

Just compare the term \"self-explanatory\" and the term \"archeological find.\" It's a pretty hard task to find out what technology is and what it should do if you don't have a clue about the context. Usually the use is connected with the object through definition (\"instructions for use\"). Turning an object against the use inscribed in it means probing its possibilities.\r\nScience and Technology Studies (especially Langdon Winner and Bruno Latour) have convincingly demonstrated that the widespread inability to understand technological artifacts as fabricated entities, as social and cultural phenomena, derives from the fact that in retrospect only those technologies that prove functional for a culture and can be integrated into everyday life are \"left over.\" However, the perception of what is functional, successful, and useful is itself the product of social and cultural, and, last but not least, political and economic processes.

Here are the last vestiges of true education, where individuals still take objects and learn from them - observe, break apart, analyze, fix, and piece back together. If we can accept the productive and creative capacities of such spaces, and use them as community centers for learning, we have the potential to become the next big force in public education. This talk will be about hacking education as we hack anything else. That is, break the existing system, throw out what gets in the way (tests, outdated formulas, teacher-centric classrooms), reconstruct the pieces conducive to learning (inquiry, manipulatives, the outdoors, the real world, use of tools), and piece back together an education system that works for us, rather than against us.","timestamp":"1279454400","location":"Bell","speakers":[{"name":"Christina 'fabulous' Pei","bio":"is a Wall Street analyst turned math teacher turned math pirate.

The leaker had reportedly boasted to hacker Adrian Lamo (after seeing his name in a <i>Wired<\/i> article) about sending 260,000 U.S. State Department classified documents to wikileaks.org. According to Lamo, that claim was enough to make him decide to call the authorities and become an informant. The U.S. government became extremely interested in finding out whether Assange had these documents at wikileaks.org and it became abundantly clear that his appearance in the States to speak at HOPE would lead to interrogations, detainment, and possibly worse. At press time, the alleged leaker (an Army intelligence analyst), was being held incommunicado in a U.S. Army brig in Kuwait pending charges.\r\nOur community has been thrust into the middle of this global controversy due to the multiple connections to the various players.

Sometimes it involves international headlines, government investigations, and emergency corporate board meetings. Other times something spectacular happens. Either way, we\u2019re setting aside an hour at the end of the conference to explain just what happened and how it all came to be.","timestamp":"1279472400","location":"Tesla","speakers":[]},{"id":"99","title":"Sniper Forensics - Changing the Landscape of Modern Forensics and Incident Response","description":"At one time, computer forensics consisted of pulling the plug, imaging everything in sight, and loading those images into a massive forensics program for \u201canalysis.\u201d As computer hackers became more resourceful, the complexity of computer forensics increased exponentially. Add to that the growing size of data storage devices, and it becomes infeasible to even consider imaging tens or hundreds of terabytes, let alone loading those images into some forensic software. So what's the answer? How can incident responders hope to remain relevant in today's operating environment? With Sniper Forensics! In addition to offering tips and tools, this talk will provide real world examples of how the landscape of modern forensics is being changed.","timestamp":"1279472400","location":"Lovelace","speakers":[{"name":"Chris Pogue","bio":"is a senior security analyst for the Spiderlabs incident response and digital forensics team at Trustwave.

Sure, there are those who leave early on Sunday because they have to get back to whatever it is they do in the real world bright and early Monday morning. But if you fancy something a bit more celebratory and different, we suggest you stick around as the conference truly winds down. This is where you hear some of the back story of the conference, get a chance to win some prizes, and hopefully help us put the hotel back in the state in which we found it. Maybe even a better state.\r\n[Speaking of the hotel, at press time it appears that a major public hearing will be taking place the day after HOPE concerning the proposed demolition of the hotel where public opinion will be sought. If this remains the case, there will never be a better opportunity to show those in charge how important the Hotel Pennsylvania is to the world. You don\u2019t have to be from New York to participate - in fact, the more people from all parts of the globe who speak up, the better. We will have updated information on this throughout the conference.]\r\nWe hope to see even more people than the usual huge mob for this special closing.","timestamp":"1279476000","location":"Tesla","speakers":[]}]
