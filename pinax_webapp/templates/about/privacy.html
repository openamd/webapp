<p><b>Privacy Policy</b>
<p>
We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes OpenAMD's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the OpenAMD Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.

<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b>
<p>
OpenAMD uses information we collect to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track User Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
<p>
<b>User-Provided Information:</b> You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register for a member account with the Service. Your name and other information you choose to add to your profile will be available for public viewing on the Service. We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). You can control receipt of certain Service-related messages on your Settings page. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.
<p>
You also provide us information in User Content you post to the Service. Your questions, answers, and other contributions on the Service, and metadata about them (such as when you posted them), are publicly viewable on the Service, along with your name (unless the Service permits you to post anonymously). This information may be searched by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Web in accordance with our Terms of Service.
<p>
If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation. OpenAMD stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.
<p>
<b>Cookies:</b> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more "cookies" - small data files - to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let OpenAMD help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us, but does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
<p>
<b>Log Files:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
<p>
<b>Clear GIFs Information:</b> When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your OpenAMD account is collected using these clear GIFs. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make OpenAMD better for our users.
<p>
<b>How We Share Your Information</b>
<p>
We will only share your information with other attendees. It will later be released broadly to the public. You may opt-out of each of these practices. Your information will never be sold, but it does not belong to us.
<p>
<b>How We Protect Your Information</b>
<p>
OpenAMD uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to OpenAMD or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
<p>
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, OpenAMD will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
<p>
<b>Your Choices About Your Information</b>
<p>
You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case OpenAMD may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account.

<b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b>

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. You will also be notified.
